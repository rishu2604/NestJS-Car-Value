    // The type annotation on this is Repository and we applied a generic type to it of <User>.
    // So this right here means that repo is going to be an instance of a type Repository that deals with instances of users. That's what <User> right there is meant to say. This repository is going to handle users. So then the last part of this that's definitely the weirdest part is @InjectRepository with User.
    // So this is a little bit of an aid to the dependency injection system.
    // This is what is going to tell the dependency injection system that we need the user repository.
    // You might recall that when we spoke about dependency injection a little bit ago, we said that the dependency injection system uses this type annotation right here to figure out what instance it needs to inject into this class at runtime.
    // Unfortunately, the dependency injection system does not play nicely with generics, which is what this is right here.
    // So this decorator is required simply because we have to use a generic type right here.

        return this.repo.save(user); // ðŸ‘ˆ Adds or updates a record to the DB or persists the entity to the DB.
    }
    // Once again, to hook up our service to our controller, we will use dependency injection.
